	<h1>Dan Cetlin Biography</h1>
	Dan Cetlin was born in the Andes, in the town of Bread. As a boy, he liked to chase around squirrels until one day, a squirrel told him that it was not cool to do that. That squirrel, named Steve, is to this day, one of his closest friends. As a teenage boy, he would often ask his father important life questions such as "what is?" and "what it do?" His father would respond the same ever time: "it is, and it do." When he turned 18 he was forced to face 11 trials. 10 of which were stairs. The 11th test was a math test administered by Steven Hawking. But it was a regular math test that just happened to be administered by Steven Hawking. It went okay. Now he is at Tufts, and his favorite class is web design. What will the future hold for Dan Cetlin? Probably a few more years of college, then a job as a squirrel chaser.
